## Data

Sample files for a how received data will be formatted will be stored in sample_data. We do not yet know the types of data that will be required, but creating a simple working product with velocity data formatted as seen in the appropriate file is a good start. It may be to your benefit to create a dummy data generator.

Make sure the code is clean and modular so that incorporating new types of data or modifying existing model classes is easy.
